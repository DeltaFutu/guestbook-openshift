# Installing the Operator Framework and IBM Operator

The Operator Framework provides support for Kubernetes-native extensions to manage custom resource types through operators. Many operators are available through [operatorhub.io](https://operatorhub.io/), including the IBM Cloud operator. The IBM Cloud operator simplifies the creation of IBM Cloud services and resouces and binding credentials from these resources into a Kubernetes cluster. The instructions in this guide are adapted from the IBM Developer tutorial [Simplify the lifecycle management process for your Kubernetes apps with operators](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/simplify-lifecycle-management-kubernetes-openshift-ibm-cloud-operator/).

The steps in this guide require execution by a user with cluster-admin role. If you are using Minishift, be sure to enable the `admin-user` addon and then log in to the `oc` cli using this user:

`oc login -u admin -p the-admin-passwd`

## Installing the Operator Framework

Begin by applying the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) release to your cluster:

```text
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/0.10.0/crds.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/0.10.0/olm.yaml
```

Before continuing, check to ensure that the pods in the `olm` namespace have started. This can take a few minutes for the container images to be pulled and the pods to start.

```text
kubectl get pods --namespace olm
NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
catalog-operator-6bb8ffd7c5-4jwwz   1/1       Running   0          2m
olm-operator-78ff5d69cf-2ssbs       1/1       Running   0          2m
olm-operators-ts4h4                 1/1       Running   0          1m
operatorhubio-catalog-q2kwj         1/1       Running   0          1m
packageserver-567b8d96b7-d75vp      1/1       Running   0          11s
packageserver-567b8d96b7-hlx8g      0/1       Running   0          11s
```

Next, to install the Marketplace Operator (allows for adding operators from the operator marketplace) perform these steps from a folder/directory outside of the `guestbook-openshift` repository folder:

```text
git clone https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-marketplace.git
kubectl apply -f operator-marketplace/deploy/upstream/
```

Now, configure a namespace for the marketplace operators

```text
kubectl apply -f - <<END
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha2
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: marketplace-operators
  namespace: marketplace
END
```

At this point, you should be able to install any operator from the [operatorhub.io](https://operatorhub.io/) marketplace.

## Installing the IBM Cloud operator

Continue with these steps with the same user logged into the cluster. With the OLM framework and marketplace support installed, it's time to install the IBM Cloud operator. This operator will use an IBM Cloud API key to manage resources within the cluster. Begin to configure the IBM Cloud operator by logging in to the IBM Cloud account using the IBM Cloud CLI.

### IBM Cloud login

```text
ibmcloud login
```

In order to be able to provision Cloud Foundry services, choose the correct Org and Space for the IBM Cloud account (this will choose a default Org and Space if there is only one available in the account. Otherwise it will prompt )

```text
ibmcloud target --cf
```

Check the outpuit from the `ibmcloud target` command. If there is no resource group set, resulting in a message including:

`Resource group:    No resource group targeted, use 'ibmcloud target -g RESOURCE_GROUP'`

then set the target resource group to the `Default` using:

```text
ibmcloud target -g Default
```

### Create API key for IBM Cloud

Use the script from the IBM Cloud operator repository to create the API key and add it as a secret to the `default` project on Minishift:

> This command requires curl and bash. For Windows 10, they can be configured by either setting up [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

```text
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/cloud-operators/master/hack/config-operator.sh | bash
```

### Install the IBM Cloud operator from the operator marketplace

The operator marketplace catalog provides a URL for the resources to install for each operator. Install the IBM Cloud Operator with the following command:

```text
kubectl create -f https://operatorhub.io/install/ibmcloud-operator.yaml
```

Check that the pod for the IBM Cloud operator is running:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods --namespace operators
NAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ibmcloud-operator-7dd98d9754-lphll   1/1       Running   0          1m
```

## Summary

Your cluster now has the IBM Cloud operator installed. This operator is able to configure two kinds in the cluster, a **Service** and a **Binding**. The **Service** defines a specific IBM Cloud service instance type to create, and the **Binding** specifies a named binding of a service instance to a secret in the cluster. For more details about the IBM Cloud operator see the [project repository](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-operators)
